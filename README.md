# Nuxt/Express/MongoDB/JWT Database Admin Boilerplate

> Database admin starter code with Express backend API and Nuxt/Vue CRUD web app (**TO-DO: Add create/update/delete functionality, currently view-only)**. Includes universal create/update/get Express API endpoints for your MongoDB collections/schema, just add your schema to the project and edit the config. This can be useful for executing backend logic in different languages and using the API endpoints to manage your data. This data can be viewed from an admin perspective with the included Nuxt.js app with a few lines of configuration.
